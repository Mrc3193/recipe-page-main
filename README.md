### What i learned

Key Learnings and Project Insights
Developing this project significantly deepened my understanding of several web development concepts and tools.

- Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse: I gained more in-depth knowledge of Chrome DevTools, particularly learning how to use the Lighthouse tool to analyze my code and identify suggested improvements.
- HTML Semantics and Styling:
  - I deepened my understanding of heading hierarchies (h1, h2, etc.). I learned that browsers interpret an h1 nested within a sectioning element (like section or article) as the main title of that specific section, rather than the primary title of the entire page. This can lead to unexpected font size styling unless accounted for.
  - I encountered information about the Document Outlining Algorithm, which was later removed from HTML documentation because browsers didn't implement the feature.
- Challenges Without Premium Design Tools:
  - Not having access to premium design resources like Figma made this challenge more difficult. However, the experience gained was invaluable. While using Figma would have significantly streamlined the process, it would have prevented me from gaining the profound knowledge I did.
  - This necessitated a deeper understanding of the nature of elementsâ€”how they organize and interact with each other. Although I had prior knowledge of these concepts, I still had some gaps in my comprehension that this challenge helped fill.
- CSS Layout and Maintainability:
  - I significantly enhanced my knowledge of Flexbox, Grid, margin, and padding. I learned to use these CSS properties more efficiently to organize layouts
  - I also grasped the crucial role of CSS variables in code maintenance. I gained initial insights into appropriate scenarios for their use.
- Code Refinement and Optimization:
  - The first version of my project had numerous areas for improvement, including code duplication and overwrites.
  - By combining insights from an AI analysis with other tools, I managed to refine the code. I grouped several selectors and utilized variables, achieving what I believe is an acceptable final result.
